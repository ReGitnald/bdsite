## Reasons I like Tolkien

- You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
- It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
- Disney _didn't ruin it_ (okay, but Amazon might have)
- It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

## My favorite characters (in order)

1. Gandalf
2. Bilbo
3. Sam
4. Glorfindel
5. Galadriel
6. Elrond
7. Thorin
8. Sauron
9. Aragorn

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Aiya, Ambar!")
}
```
